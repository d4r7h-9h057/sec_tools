# Anonymous-Tools

Some quick scripts for a realistic pentesting linux (virtual) machine.

Those tools where written upon Backbox linux "anonymous" tool. so you need the same requirement if you intend to use these script in another distro. Normally you just need bleachbit and Backbox "anonymous" tool (which you can find in github). 

for anonymonitor, you need conky.

#######################

autobleach.sh -> Just a bleachbit in loop, but intended to used alongside with ffox. Clean traces every minute. Still a work in progress


ANONYMONITOR -> a conky config file. It runs anonymous status in loop and in foreground. just run "conky -c anonymonitor.conkyrc"
