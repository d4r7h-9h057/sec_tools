Anonymous-Tools

Some quick scripts for a realistic pentesting linux (virtual) machine.

Those tools where written upon Backbox linux "anonymous" tool. so you need the same requirement if you intend to use these script in another distro. Normally you just need bleachbit and Backbox "anonymous" tool (which you can find in github).
